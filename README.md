# Responsive-Portfolio
This project was part of the Frontend-Developer Nanodgree by Udacity.

The goal of this project was to create a responsive portfolio website for yourself. You could either work with plain HTML and CSS or with Bootstrap. I achieved this goal with the help of Bootstrap as I already had some prior knowledge working with it.
